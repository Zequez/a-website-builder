# Hoja

Hoja is a cultural operative system that runs on the web. Using Hoja, each person takes responsibility for managing their own websites. The system is build as a patchwork of everyone's websites.

An Hoja node allows you to host any number of websites.

At the time there is only one node at [hoja.ar](https://hoja.ar) managed by Ezequiel.

There are many ways to interact with Hoja.

## Node Beneficiary

The tradition is that for having a website using Hoja you pay a pay-as-much-as-you-want monthly subscription to the Node Ambassador or Node Administrator that served you. He's your contact for any support in using Hoja.

## Node Ambassador

Anyone can join to onboard people into a node, just ask for a special account to any Node Administrator. The tradition is that while you use an Hoja node administrated by someone else you share 50% of subscriptions income with the node administrator.

## Node Administrator

Additionally you can learn to host your own node and keep 100% subscription income, this requires learning some programming skills.

The tradition is that the Node Administrator holds space Ambassador to learn all necessary skills to manage their own Node and collaborating in creating the Hoja's core system.


## Node Investors

If you want to support the growth of Hoja financially, investment is given directly to Node Administrators.

The investment is paid pack from subscriptions at a 50% split rate until the investment is paid back in full. The paid-back amount is split among Node Investors proportionally to the invested amount left to be paid back.

Additionally, Node Investors are invited to play Node Ambassador roles, which makes it so after th
investment is paid back, they still can receive income from everyone they onboarded.
